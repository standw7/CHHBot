- Keep a news channel going. The idea is that the bot can have twitter feeds registered to it and it will post it all into one news channel. That way the relevent reporters and accounts can have their posts posted in one place. Furthermore, the bot should automatically embed any twitter/instagram posts from anyone sent anywhere in the server. For example, x.com becomes fxtwitter.com
