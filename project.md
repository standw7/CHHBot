Things that claude code should do while coding this project: 

- After every step claude should update this file with the current project progress, what was just done, and references for use with a future llm. This LLM should be able to reference this file and pick up exactly where claude code left off in coding. 

- After every compile, claude code should read this file to regain the context of what it needs to do and what has been done 

- Always save the changes to the code into the github repo. This repo will be named the same as the project file. 

- Ask clarifying questions when needed.
